        <h1>Surviving Baby</h1>
          <p>What a joy! You have a new Baby....</p>
          <p>You (the Parent figure) will be selecting cards in the game of chance to see if you will make it through the day. </p>
          <p>You begin with a Mental Health Score of 0....hey, it was a rough night. You're fragile. If you make it to the end of 3 rounds, drawing 3 cards each round, with a Mental Health Score of 5 or More, you win! If, at the end of 3 Rounds you have a Score of 4 or Less, the Baby destroyed you and you are on the ground, barely alive! Good Luck!</p>
